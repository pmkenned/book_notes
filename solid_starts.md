# How to Start Solids & Raise a Happy Eater

- Eating the same foods as family is doable
- Five steps
  - Aim for family meals with similar foods for baby as adults.
  - Set boundaries from the start: you choose the menu, you set the schedule,
    you choose any additional rules.
  - Trust that baby is capable of learning, allow them to learn; try not to do
    it for them. Trust baby to know when they are hungry and full.
  - Trust yourself to know when it's time to step in or get help.
  - Expect mistakes.
- Wait for baby to be ready, look for developmental signs
  - Sits with support: need head, neck, and trunk control
  - Active reaching while sitting
  - Interest in food and eating
- Chair: safest option for eating
  - Upright seat
  - Adjustable footplate: knees at 90 degrees
  - Removable tray
- Three main approaches when it comes to starting solids:
  - Spood-fed
  - Baby-lead weaning
  - A combination
- Spoon-fed:
  - Begins with purees, then pureed fruits, vegetables and meats
  - Finger-foods typically introduced around 8 months
  - Benefits:
    - Eating right from the start
    - Caregiver has a sense of control
    - Exposure to many flavors
  - Drawbacks:
    - Lack of research
    - Not developmentally necessary
    - Risky for picky eating
    - Potential for missing baby's "I'm full" signs
    - Delays chewing practice
- Baby-led weaning
  - Goes straight for self-feading
  - Benefits
    - Research-based safe
    - Reduces of risk of picky eating
    - Improved development of oral motor skills
  - Drawbacks
    - More gagging at the start, less later
    - Can be messier
    - Baby may reject being spood fed
- Combined approach
  - Start with a period of spoon feeding at the start, then switch early
  - Benefits
    - Potential for "best of both worlds"
    - Allows for intake and chewing practice
  - May include same downsides as both other approaches
- Recommended: first food first with a modified combo approach
- Remember, babies are resilient. Follow the baby's lead and your intuition.
- Responsive Spoon Feeding
  - Prevent picking eating:
    - Serve the family meal
    - Give baby control over the eating experience
  - You can use foods that are naturally pureed (oatmeal, etc) or puree food
  - Responsive spoon-feeding: hold spoon to the mouth and waits for permission
- Timing and scheduling meals
  - One meal per day at first around 6 to 7 months
  - Aim for times when baby is awake, alert, calm
  - Consider adding breast milk meal 20 minutes before and after meal
  - Breastmilk should still be primary source until 11 or 12 months
  - If baby is fussy, may be best to skip the meal
  - Sample schedule at 45:45
  - Baby should pick up foods
- What to expect from baby at meals
  - Baby may need you to show it how
  - Baby might play with food
  - Baby may spit out food, which is an important skill
  - If you notice that baby coughs multiple times per meal, mention it to doctor
  - Do not put fingers in baby's mouth
  - They might overstuff their mouth, tell them to slow down and remove food
  - Don't offer new foods if they're crying because they don't like the food
  - Red flags
    - Throwing or refusing to pick up food at most meals
    - Gagging to the point of vomiting at most meals
  - Contact doctor if you see red flags
- What food to serve baby
  - What foods you love, or are seasonal
  - Vegetables, fruits, whole grains, simply prepared meats
  - Foods high in iron, serve often
  - Stewed meats, chicken or beaf liver are good options
  - Meat served on a bone: beaf/pork/lamb ribs, chicken drumstick
  - Remove gristle
  - Lentils, chickpeas
  - Don't worry about amount consumed
  - Offer colorful and flavorful foods early and often; options at 1:02:23
  - See first 100 days meal plan
- Preparing food for baby
  - Prioritize finger food from the start
  - Risk for choking increases if somebody else puts food in baby's mouth
  - Hemp seeds give grip
  - Width for food items: 1 to 2 finger widths
  - Small foods like blueberries and blackbeans are choking hazards
  - They can be mashed or mixed with sauces
  - Textures: should be soft enough to be mashed but not so soft they fall apart
  - Food that can snap (carrots, raw apple, etc.) are not recommended unless cooked
  - You can offer firm foods which can't break apart, like spare ribs or mango pits
  - When using pureed foods, leave in lumps for practice with texture
  - Allow baby to practice loading the spoon themselves
- Portion size and food waste
  - Keep portions small at first
  - Many options can be overwhelming
  - Don't make food just for your baby, make food for yourself and share
- Foods to avoid
  - Foods that might make baby sick
    - Honey: avoid until over 12 months
    - Raw or undercooked meats, poultry, seafood
    - Raw dairy
  - Choking hazards
    - Round, slippery, firm foods: peanuts, graps, firm blueberries
    - Large globs of nutbutters, fishes with bones
    - Cut up or cook until soft
  - Processed, sugary, or salty
- Gagging, Choking and Infant Rescue
  - Gagging provides baby opportunity to learn
  - Leaping to the baby's aid can scare them
  - Can get down low, have them lean forward and put your hand in front of their mouth
  - Never put your finger in baby's mouth
  - BLISS study: no differences between baby-lead weaning and purees in terms of choking
  - Choking is rare, gagging is common
  - Characteristics of choking hazards: roundness, firmness, slipperyness
  - What to do if baby is choking: 1:44:40
    - Call 911 and alternate between back blows (5) and chest thrusts (5)
  - Choking is rare
  - Gagging can be ugly and dramatic, but it is not an emergency
  - If choking, baby will look terrified
- Cups and Straws
  - Introduce around 6 months
