# The Art of Unix Programming

## Chapter 2: History

- Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS): grandfather of Unix
- Multics: father of Unix
- First implemented in assembler on PDP-7, then PDP-11
- Unix's first real job in 1971: `nroff`
- Rewritten in C in 1971
- 1974: ACM article gave Unix its first public exposure
- 1979: Version 7, recognizable to modern Unix programmer
- Microsoft started work on XENIX in 1980
- In 1980, DARPA chose Unix as the OS on which to implement TCP/IP on VAX machines
- Sun Microsystems launched in 1982
- 1983: Richard Stallman starts working on GNU
- By 1983, there were at least six Unix-like OS's for the IBM PC, but none were
  commercial successes
- 1982: DOJ wins second anti-trust case against AT&T and breaks up the Bell
  System
- AT&T was then able to commercialize Unix System V
- This resulted in a clamp down on the distribution of Unix source code
- Companies sought advantage via product differentiation, which fragmented the
  Unix ecosystem
- The Unix community was preoccupied with a battle between System V and BSD
  - Programmers tended to prefer BSD; business typed with AT&T/System V
- Larry Wall writes `patch`, which boosts internet collaboration
- 1985: 80386 is released; Stallman writes GNU Manifesto and founds FSF
- Also 1985: POSIX standards
- 1986: Larry Wall begins work on `Perl`
- 1987: first version of `gcc` appears
- IBM rejects 386 in favor of 286 for the PS/2 line, which ends in failure
- Compaq makes IBM PC clones using the 386 which is powerful enough to run Unix
- In 1988, AT&T allied with Sun, healing breach between System V and BSD
- The second phase of the Unix Wars began when second-tier vendors lined up
  against AT&T/Sun
- By early 90s, the Unix project seemed to have failed; Microsoft was the new
  monopoly in the PC market
- 1990: 386BSD project began; a startup company, BSDI, backed this port
- 1991: Linux project begins
- A lawsuit from AT&T against BSDI took a toll on the BSD project
- Conventional Unix vendors became irrelevant, all the focus went to Linux and
  BSD
- Hacker/ARPANET culture began to fuse after 1983 when TCP/IP was ported to BSD
- BSD, with a more permissive license, opposed Stallman's GPL
