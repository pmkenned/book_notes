## Chapter 4: Responsibility: Transmitting Values Rather Than Demanding Compliance

- Chores may have a negative impact
- Children who are given the opportunity to make decisions grow up to be
  self-supporting
- Parental attitude: willingness to allow children to feel all their feelings
- Parental skill: an ability to demonstrate to children acceptable ways of
  coping with feelings
- Ways that parents often fail to do this: denial, disowning, suppression,
  prettifying
- Long-term program: become interested in what children are thinking and
  feeling and respond not just to their behavior but to the feelings that
  trigger that behavior
- Motto: let me understand, let me show that I understand, let me show in words
  that do not criticize or condemn
- Examples: "It seems like you had a hard day" rather than "What's wrong?"
- Provide emotional first-aid, do not criticize
- Parent's should choose carefully which family events are necessary for the
  children to attend
- Showing children that we respect their feelings gives the child a sense of
  self-worth
- When we label our children, they incorporate this into their view of
  themselves
- Parents should state their own feelings without attacking
  - Start sentences with "I"
- When parents listen with sensitivity, it encourages the same in the child

## Chapter 5: Discipline: Finding Effective Alternatives to Punishment

- Discipline is finding effective alternatives to punishment
  - Punishment creates anger and hatred, blocks learning
- Misbehavior and punishment are not opposites, they reinforce each other
- Cost of having an urgent need to be loved
- Permissiveness: all feelings are allowed, symbolic expressions are encouraged
- Overpermissiveness: allowing undesirable acts
- Help children with both their conduct and their feelings
- Encouraged, allowed, and forbidden
  - Forbidding unacceptable behavior is as important as encouraging desirable behavior
- Ways of phrasing limits
  - Put children's wishes in simple words
  - State clearly the limits on a specific act
  - Point out how the wish could at least be partially fulfilled
  - Held the child to express some of the resentment they feel from the rule
- Limits should be phrased succintly and impersonally
- Don't overly restrict physical activity of children
- Children should never be allowed to hit parents
- Parents should not hit children
