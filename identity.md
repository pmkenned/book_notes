### Introduction

- It's amazing we're doing as well as we are, given the challenges of identity
- Many aspects of our society are working against our ability to form a sense of our identity
- Identity belongs at the base of Maslow's hierarchy of needs
  - Contrary to what you may hear, this is not just a first-world problem, it is fundamental element of human survival
  - When society disrupts identity, it is a core threat; you cannot function without a sense of identity
- Problem: nobody knows what identity is; definitions vary
  - Psychology, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, political science, economics each have their own theories
  - Working definition: sense of yourself as an individual in relation to the society around you, both immediate (friends, family) and more broadly (village, state, globe)
- Can't just have a sense of identity in yourself
- Many current manifestations of libertarianism absurdly argue that we don't need government or communities, they just repress the individual
  - This is a complete misreading of the world
  - Often asserted by tech-elite, which is ironic since they benefit from comprehensive set of rules (standards for trade, communication, programming languages, etc) which are created by governments, corporations, social agreements
  - So when libertarians claim bitcoin will liberate us from government control, this is silly because it just ties the individual to a different (perhaps preferable) structure; doesn't eliminate rules, just changes them
- We tend to overlook how much of our world is built on cooperation (e.g. languages)
  - On the one hand, this is very restrictive, but also very liberating
- Ayn Rand: individual should follow no communal rules

### Chimpanzee ancestors

- Incredibly social
  - In almost every moment, chimps are having their place within their society reinforced or challenged (examples)
  - Social reinforcement is not just one separate activity among others, but a facet of every activity
